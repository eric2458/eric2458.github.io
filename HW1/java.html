                <h2>About Java</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java was initially named "Oak" by its creator, James Gosling,
                        reportedly after an oak tree outside his office at Sun Microsystems.
                        The name was later changed to "Java" due to a trademark conflict.</li>                        
                    <li>Java wasn't initially conceived as a general-purpose programming language.
                        Gosling and his team were working on a project for interactive television
                        systems and, while cleaning up C++ code, realized the need for a more
                        robust and platform-independent language, which led to the creation of Java.</li>
                    <li>Java is widely used in enterprise-level applications, with a significant
                        percentage of corporate workstations and enterprise apps relying on it.</li>
                    <li>The Android operating system heavily utilizes Java APIs, making Java a fundamental
                        language for Android app development.</li>
                </ul>
