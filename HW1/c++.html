                <h2>About C++</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1979.
                        It was initially called "C with Classes" and later renamed "C++" 
                        by Rick Massity in 1983, with "++" signifying the increment operator
                        in C, symbolizing an enhancement over the original C language.</li>                        
                    <li>C++ introduced key OOP concepts such as classes, objects, 
                        encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which were not
                        present in C. </li>
                    <li>C++ offers deterministic destructors for classes, a feature that
                        provides precise control over resource management and is not commonly
                        found in other object-oriented languages.</li>
                    <li>C++ is known for its high performance and efficiency, making it a preferred
                        choice for developing high-performance applications. It is widely used in
                        operating systems, game development, embedded systems, financial applications,
                        and scientific research. Examples include Microsoft Office, TensorFlow
                        (backend), and parts of the Bitcoin source code.</li>
